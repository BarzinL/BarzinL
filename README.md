# 👋 Hi, I'm @BarzinL
- 🚀 I'm the founder of [SANCTVS Inc.](https://www.sanctus.ca), a marketing and technology company.
- 🌐 Sanctus originates in and currently only has a presence in Toronto, Canada.
- 💼 I'm a bootstrapped entrepreneur that specializes in IT solutions, marketing, cybersecurity, AI, and custom media production.
- 🔧 I'm currently working on:
  - **LOGOS-1:** LOGOS-1 is an attempt to create an entirely new tokenizer paradigm, using a hierarchical tokenization model that constructs enriched meaning at each level and enables advanced AI functionality current language and multimodal models do not possess.
  - **NGL-1:** Or "Neuro-Generative Logic 1," a custom AI project for Sanctus using the most cutting-edge AI research and programmed entirely from scratch in JuliaLang, aimed at creating a state-of-the-art AI model. NGL-1 is designed from the ground up to be capable of advanced reasoning and address many of the shortcomings in even the best current AI models.
  - **Talia:** An expansive RPG & universe simulation with procedural generation, advanced agricultural realism, and event-driven rarity.
  - **[Minerva](https://github.com/sanctus-inc/Minerva):** A FOSS alternative creativity suite built using Julia and VulkanCore.jl.
  - **Extending Cross-Compilation Support for Julia:** For at least the sake of both Talia and Minerva, I'll be contributing to helping make Julia's cross-compilation capabilities more streamlined.
  - **Kola Nut Syrup:** I love cola and I'm creating a holy grail small-batch cola syrup for my SodaStream. 🤷🏻‍♂️ (Spoilers: I have not had any time to work on this ☹️)
- 💡 I'm interested in collaborating on:
  - Open-source software development
  - AI and machine learning projects
  - Advanced simulation and procedural generation
  - Marketing and digital strategy innovations
- 🧬 I'm deeply interested in longevity medicine and the science of extending healthy lifespan.
  - There are [12 hallmarks of aging](images/12Hallmarks2.jpg), and software & AI solutions that aid in research & treatment delivery are critical areas we can innovate in.
  - I also guide the [Canadian Longevity Association](https://www.canadianlongevity.ca/) with respect to their marketing & technical/AI strategies, as well as developing applications to assist their mission.
- 📚 I'm constantly learning about:
  - Biochemistry and pharmacokinetics of plant medicines
  - Advanced programming techniques in Julia
  - Sustainable and innovative agricultural practices
