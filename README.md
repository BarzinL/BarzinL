# 👋 Hi, I'm Barzin
- 🚀 I'm the founder of [SANCTVS Inc.](https://www.sanctus.ca), a marketing and technology company.
- 🌐 Sanctus originates in and currently only has a presence in Toronto, Canada.
- 💼 I'm a bootstrapped entrepreneur that specializes in IT solutions, marketing, cybersecurity, AI, and custom media production.
- 🔧 I'm currently working on:
  - **NGL:** Or "Neuro-Generative Logic" an AI research project for Sanctus synthesizing all of my research and knowledge of AI, aimed primarily at pushing forward basic research.
  - **Talia:** An expansive RPG & universe simulation with procedural generation, advanced agricultural realism, and event-driven rarity.
  - **[Minerva](https://github.com/sanctus-inc/Minerva):** A FOSS alternative creativity suite built using Julia and VulkanCore.jl.
  - **Kola Nut Syrup:** I love cola and I'm creating a holy grail small-batch cola syrup for my SodaStream. 🤷🏻‍♂️ (Spoilers: I have not had any time to work on this ☹️)
- 💡 I'm interested in collaborating on:
  - Open-source software development
  - AI and machine learning projects
  - Advanced simulation and procedural generation
  - Marketing and digital strategy innovations
- 🧬 I'm **very deeply** interested in longevity medicine and the science of extending healthy lifespan.
  - There are [12 hallmarks of aging](images/12Hallmarks2.jpg), and software & AI solutions that aid in research & treatment delivery are critical areas we can innovate in.
  - I was a former AI and marketing advisor to the [Canadian Longevity Association](https://www.canadianlongevity.ca/).
  - I am also the President of the [Biorejuvenation and Anti-aging Research & Technology Group](https://clubs.ssfinc.ca/BART/) (BART for short) at Seneca Polytechnic, the first post-secondary student club of its kind in all of Ontario (and possibly all of Canada!) dedicated to advancing research the scientific, philosophical, and societal aspects of anti-aging and age-reversal technologies.
- 📚 I'm constantly learning about:
  - Biochemistry, the pharmacokinetics of plant medicines, and whatever I can absorb about human health.
  - Python, Julia, and other languages that can push medical advances forward.
  - Sustainable and innovative agricultural practices.
